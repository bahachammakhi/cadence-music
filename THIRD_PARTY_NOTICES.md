# Assets, dependencies and external services

## Included original material

Cadence source and documentation are licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). The original Cadence mark, generated icon/artwork and generated demo audio included here are covered by that license as well. The project does not grant an exclusive trademark right or imply endorsement of a fork.

`Scripts/generate-icon.swift` creates the original Core Graphics brand geometry; `Scripts/generate-demo.py` synthesizes three short instrumental WAVs. `Scripts/generate-device-mockups.py` draws original, generic device frames around those screenshots; it does not use Apple marketing device art. The retained README screenshots show original demo artwork/music and app UI, not commercial album covers. These are sample materials, not a mainstream music catalog.

## Platform resources

The app uses Apple's system frameworks, fonts and SF Symbols under the applicable Apple platform terms. This repository does not relicense those resources or include Apple's SDKs. Xcode and distribution tooling are separately obtained from Apple. XcodeGen is a separate build tool with its own license; it is not vendored here.

There are no third-party Swift package dependencies in the current package manifest. Review this notice when adding dependencies or assets.

## Referenced services

Aurral, Spotify, Apple Music/iTunes metadata and Tailscale are independently operated projects/services with their own licenses, terms and trademarks. Cadence is an independent client and is not affiliated with or endorsed by them. Aurral server code, provider tools, recordings and provider credentials are not distributed in this repository.

External catalog metadata, artwork, previews and recordings remain subject to their owners' rights and applicable service terms. The MIT license for Cadence does not grant rights to external content or permission to access a source. Configure sources you are authorized to use and avoid redistributing downloaded music or live album-art screenshots as project assets.

## Landing page

The separate `site/` web project uses npm dependencies recorded in its lockfile, including Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Radix Slot, Class Variance Authority, clsx, tailwind-merge Phosphor icons and the PostHog JavaScript SDK. Their licenses remain with their respective authors; package distributions include the applicable notices. They are not dependencies of the native Swift apps.

The Button is adapted from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) under MIT; its notice is retained in [site/SHADCN-LICENSE.md](site/SHADCN-LICENSE.md). Manrope is bundled locally under the SIL Open Font License; see [FONT-LICENSE.txt](site/public/FONT-LICENSE.txt). The website uses copies of this project's original brand artwork and reviewed demo screenshots.
