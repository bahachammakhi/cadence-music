# Privacy and data flow

This describes the current source, not the privacy practices of your separately operated music server or external providers.

## Where data goes

- **Your configured Aurral server:** account authentication, library/search requests, playlist/favorite changes, preparation/import requests and audio streaming. Server operators control their own storage, logs and providers.
- **Apple's public Search API:** All music search terms, metadata lookups and normal network information such as IP address. Aurral credentials are not attached. The client uses the US catalog; it does not authenticate to Apple Music.
- **Artwork/preview hosts:** displaying external artwork or playing Discover previews may contact the URLs returned by catalog/server metadata. Those hosts can receive normal request information. Full playback uses your library audio rather than substituting previews.
- **Spotify integrations:** playlist links and import settings go through Aurral; the server may need its own Spotify connection. Browser OAuth is handled by the user and provider. Cadence does not include a shared Spotify credential.
- **Your paired devices:** WatchConnectivity transfers music, metadata, receipts and control state. Private Mac control exchanges encrypted playback state/commands over Tailscale; Bonjour advertises non-secret connection information on the nearby network.

The native Cadence apps include no advertising, analytics or tracking SDK. It has no Cadence cloud account or listening-profile synchronization. This does not prevent your server, operating system, VPN or contacted providers from keeping their own logs.

## On-device storage

Server credentials and native-session data use Keychain on iPhone/Mac. Credentials use this-device-only accessibility. Downloaded audio, cached artwork/catalog details, queue state, listening history, followed artists, bookmarks and preparation metadata live on the device. Account-scoped files and generation checks separate sessions; account hashes are identifiers, not encryption of music metadata. These files are not an application-level encrypted vault.

The Watch receives audio and state without server credentials. Mac pairing links contain device identity, private address and port; treat them as private network information even though they contain no password.

Sign-out clears credentials and local downloaded music/cache and invalidates active account work. iPhone sign-out also requests Watch erasure through WatchConnectivity; an offline Watch may not receive that immediately. Do not interpret sign-out as a complete wipe of every account-scoped listening/preparation record: those stores can survive for the same account's next sign-in. **Clear history** removes listening events without deleting follows/bookmarks; **Clear completed** cleans finished preparation rows. Server playlists and accepted acquisition jobs remain on the server. Device backups and OS-managed storage have their own retention behavior.

## Permissions

- Background audio supports playback when the app is not foreground.
- Local-network permission and Bonjour support private Mac discovery/control.
- WatchConnectivity and background URLSession support scheduled file delivery/downloads; their timing is controlled by the OS.

No microphone, calendar, health, location or contacts permission is requested by the current app. The bundled privacy manifest declares no tracking/collected-data categories and the UserDefaults required-reason use. Distribution maintainers must review actual behavior, third-party endpoints and Apple's current disclosure rules before submission; the manifest is not a substitute for that review.

## Reporting safely

Redact server addresses, account names, tokens, passwords, cookies, private pairing links, signed audio URLs and personal artwork/history before sharing logs or screenshots. Never commit `.build`, live test fixtures, Keychain exports or Apple signing files. See [security reporting](../SECURITY.md).

## Public website analytics

The separate landing page at `cadence.bmerce.net` uses PostHog cookieless analytics for page views, approximate visitor counts, referrer domains, browser/device categories and explicit download/source/documentation link clicks. It does not identify users, record sessions, or capture arbitrary interactions. Query strings, fragments, unknown paths and unapproved event properties are removed before capture. Recognized campaign sources are limited to a short allowlist. Browser Do Not Track, Global Privacy Control and a local opt-out preference disable collection.

The website's [privacy page](https://cadence.bmerce.net/privacy/) provides the opt-out control and explains network processing and third-party hosting. Website analytics is separate from music playback, listening history and server credentials. The native apps still have no analytics SDK.
